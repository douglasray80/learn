## Introduction to the Information Security and Quality Assurance Projects

Time to put your new javascript skills to work! These challenges will be similar to the advanced node and express challenges but more difficult. This will allow you to prove how much you have learned.

In this section you will create the following small JavaScript programs:

- Metric-Imperial Converter
- Issue Tracker
- Personal Library
- Stock Price Checker
- Anonymous Message Board

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.

Good Luck!
